        <h2>The Most Interesting Man in the World: B. Kushnir</h2>
        <p>You all know him. You all love him!<br>Except, actually, you probably don't. How unfortunate.</p>
        <p>I'm sure you're all curious about me; after all, for the ~99.9999999625% of you who don't know me, I'm some faceless &mdash; yet oddly intriguing &mdash; e-dude.</p>
        <p>For your convenience, I've taken the liberty of coming up with questions I would ask a new pal <i>and</i> I've answered them below!</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>What's your legal name?</dt>
            <dd>My name is (approximately) Shmruno Shmushnir. I think you can figure out the rest :)</dd>
            <dt>What's your legal title?</dt>
            <dd>Depending on the context, my name may be prefixed with <q>high-school senior,</q> <q>senior patrol leader,</q> <q>life scout,</q> or <q>nature director.</q></dd>
            <dt>What's your social security number?</dt>
            <dd>It's roughly "012-01-0123", with only 40% of the characters in that string being definitely incorrect!</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>If you know my contact info and you've got some good ideas for questions, let me know! I wrote these myself so I'm unsure how useful they'll be to you all.</p>
