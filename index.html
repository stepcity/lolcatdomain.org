    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>
        There's not really much to say about me! I'd like to describe myself as
        a cool dude with some rad interests and based opinions. In the spirit of
        full disclosure, many of those are negative - I think there's a lot to
        dislike right now - but I try to keep a clear separation between that
        (my rants) and the things that are actually interesting (my posts).
    </p>
    <p>
        So far, I haven't written much here, but I've got a lot of interests,
        including (but not limited to) (and very generally) computers, nature,
        and languages. Now just recursively add every sub- and super- interest,
        and you've got the complete list of my interests!
