        <h2>Dear Merry,</h2>
        <p>We met three years ago, and since then, I've considered you to be one of the most interesting people I know. I wanted to take this opportunity to write to you about just what makes you quite so great.</p>
        <p>We've talked <i>very</i> often for me, and despite some pretty big differences &mdash; our timezones, our cultures &mdash; I've never found you to be anything but easy to talk to.</p>
        <p>And oh, man, do we talk! I'm generally antisocial and oftentimes I just don't want to talk to anyone, and yet you never seem to fail to come up with something that piques me. From our concerns about the present to our hopes and dreams for the future, or our mutual interest in plants and animals and fungi and all things natural, or just life in general, I don't think I've ever felt sick of talking to you.</p>
        <p>I'd be leaving out some key information if I didn't point out that you don't just talk the talk, you walk the walk. I've spoken to innumerable people with equally many opinions about something that they have zero experience with. You? You talk from experience. You recently sent me a 19-page document describing everything you know about, well, a lot of things, really. I don't think I've ever felt more impressed with the sheer knowledge someone has about their interests, and that's not even mentioning the actual work you've put in behind the scenes. Spending your free time collecting seeds to grow into plants, cleaning up your local nature, contacting your wholesale aluminum recycling guy &nbsp; it's obvious to anyone who knows you that you're as legitimately hip as it gets.</p>
        <p>I recently had a friend over, and while I showed him around, he kept looking at me wide-eyed and saying "I wish I was that cool." That feeling &mdash; that understanding that you are in the presence of someone who leads exactly the life they aim to lead &mdash; is exactly what I feel when I spend time with you, Merry. You do what you do because it's what you want to do.</p>
        <p>I'm not the best emotional writer, so you'll have to forgive me for the somewhat chaotic structure. I only hope that you glean as much meaning from this as I felt writing it :)</p>
        <p>So, with that having been said...</p>
        <p><b>Happy birthday, Merry!</b></p>
