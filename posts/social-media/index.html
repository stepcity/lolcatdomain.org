        <h2>The internet's gone in the wrong direction. (!!!)</h2>
        <p>... and it's infected the rest of society.</p>
        <p>For someone who spends as much time on a computer as I do, you'd think that I stay online and up-to-date with all the latest technological marvels. And for a short time, I did.</p>
        <p>But all that time I've spent has helped me realize everything that's wrong with how it all works. I don't think I can convince anyone to change &mdash; I'm not writing this to argue my perspective. I'm writing this to justify to everyone who's complained why it's so difficult to interact with me online.</p>
        <h3>A Privacy Nightmare</h3>
        <p>I spent the formative years of my life online. Before I knew what I was doing, I was handing out personal information about myself to any and every internet service I felt useful.</p>
        <p>They say the internet never forgets, but they never really specify what that <i>means</i>. It doesn't mean some hypothetical job interviewer can see that I went to a party in the 11th grade. No, it means that Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and other tech giants have built profiles of my personality that they will never delete. The sheer scale of the data collected about everybody is unfathomable.</p>
        <p>And none of this, <b>none</b> of my personal information, is under my control. Take my Discord account. I created it in 2018 &mdash; before I knew better &mdash; and since then, it's been accumulating personal information. Once I learned about just how much Discord knows about me, I obviously decided to delete my account... only to find out that Discord never actually deletes your account, it just renames you to "Deleted User 123" and locks you out.</p>
        <p>The full story is obviously more complex, but that's the gist of it. If you have any sense of digital privacy, you'll immediately recognize that this simply won't do. That's why at every opportunity, I avoid trying anything extra.</p>
        <h3>My Mind is Rotting</h3>
        <p>I know the most generic thing to say is that social media rots your brain, but it's true. I feel it happening, all the time, and I don't even use it.</p>
        <p>Social media takes everything I hold near and dear and corrupts it into some 15-second long clip that can be mass-marketed and forgotten immediately. It's the source of the Entrendification by which things that are fun become pointless and overdone.</p>
        <p>Example A: Kate Bush. I've listened to her music for ages, since as long as I can remember, and I assume I'm not alone. It's good music! But for many, their first introduction to it was via its use in Stranger Things and subsequent Entrendification via TikTok. And no, this wasn't "getting the kids interested in music!" &mdash; this was a short clip of the most catchy part of one song played over and over again on repeat. Now when I tell people that I like Kate Bush, they go "Oh! Like from TikTok!" and then I strangle them.</p>
        <p>Example B: The bus ride to school. I sit down on the bus, I put in my headphones, and I put on a bit of the ol' Ludwig Van, and am promptly interrupted by a short clip of Kate Bush. And then that same clip. And then that same clip. And then that same clip. My listening experience is ruined twofold! Not only am I incapable of enjoying Kate Bush because of how annoying it's become, I am also incapable of enjoying anything else.</p>
        <p>There's more than just Kate Bush, of course. Almost every single mainstream artist has been subjected to this same torture of being reduced to their most trendy moment before being driven into the ground. I feel as though I am incapable of enjoying what I used to, simply because of how social media is distorting it. It's like the scene from "A Wrinkle in Time" wherein IT is abusing the rhythms of Meg's struggling in order to break her.</p>
        <h3>But You Have <i>Got</i> to Try It!</h3>
        <p>Literally! You don't have a choice!</p>
        <p>See, the most insidious thing about all this is that there is no way to live without it. Even if I'm maybe not the best at it, I really do need to socialize. But when socializing with anybody else depends on the existence of the internet, well, suddenly I'm shit outta luck.</p>
        <p>For example, I have an Instagram account. I don't use it &mdash; the only feature I need out of Instagram is the instant messenger. For some reason, instead of simply using text messages, everybody's got their own Internet Service of Choice: Instagram, Snapchat, Discord, etc. If I decide to get rid of any one of these, I am condemning myself to never befriending anyone who uses that service.</p>
        <p>Therefore, as long as I desire to socialize with social media users, I have no choice but to use social media. That's why I have Discord and Instagram accounts &mdash; too many of my friends use them exclusively for me to be able to leave.</p>
        <h3>That Last Part of a Sonnet (yknow, like where it's got a resolution and whatnot)</h3>
        <p>Luckily for me, I'm not long for this world. (As of writing this:) In a few months time, I will have graduated high school. After that, my worldly connections will be through summer camp and college, and I've chosen wisely.</p>
        <p>I've never had the opportunity to choose who I socialize with. That's not to say I dislike my friends &mdash; there's a reason I still talk to you guys &mdash; but I doubt I'd've randomly stumbled into any of them. So many of my friends view the world completely differently than I do.</p>
        <p>But when I get to choose my friends, when I get to say, "You can contact me at <code>&lt;phone number&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;email address&gt;</code>," I'll be able to slowly escape from this terrifying prison of social media.</p>

        <h2>Psst! Social Media can be Okay!</h2>
        <p>Whaaaaaaaat???? Social media can be okay??</p>
        <p>It turns out I'm not alone in my feelings! <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is a prime example of social media that has intentionally avoided my complaints. Of course, it's obtuse in other ways and is meant for geeks, but if that's up your alley &mdash; give it a shot!</p>
        <p>Likewise, <a href="https://spacehey.com/">SpaceHey</a> makes an effort to simplify things a lot. I don't appreciate its community, but I respect its design, and if you're the emo type, I recommend checking it out!</p>
        <p>I also recommend checking out some IRC servers or phpBB bulletin boards. These are mostly topic-centric and tend towards geekdom, but I've always found it easy to find the community I needed at the time.</p>
        <p>So... there is hope, after all.</p>
