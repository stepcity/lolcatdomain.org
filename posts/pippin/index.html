        <h2>Pippin: the 32-bit microprocessor we all deserved</h2>
        <p>I started getting into the operating system development hobby when I realized just how hard it is to bring up a complete system on x86 processors &mdash; its reliance on the BIOS/UEFI (aside: they <i>both</i> suck!) horribly cripples it. On the other hand, contemporary RISCs &mdash; e.g. ARM or RISC-V &mdash; either have design flaws (sorry, ARM) or are so underdeveloped that writing assembly causes me physical pain (sorry, RISC-V).</p>
        <p>The Motorola 68k series was so incredibly popular for low-cost home computers because it felt powerful and yet didn't bother with anything excessive. At least, through my rose-tinted glasses &mdash; in reality, there were a lot of problems on that front, too.</p>
        <p>My solution is to <b>make my own</b>. (!!!) I've got a working (although unpublished) spec, and I plan on writing about it here.</p>
        <p>Prepare for more posts as I work!</p>
