        <p>I'm an elitist and a perfectionist, so I spend more of my time thinking than doing. This sucks for actually getting anything done, but all the time I've spent researching to back my viewpoint has given me a serious case of <b>Too Much Information</b>. (!!!)</p>
        <p>The doctor(s) told me the only cure is for me to write down everything I think about and convince internet strangers to read it.</p>
        <p>OK, maybe that's not a real thing, but I've learned about too many based things for me to <i>not</i> write some posts about it on the internet.</p>
        <p>Anyways...</p>

        <p>On my friend Merry's birthday, I wrote: <a href="/posts/merry/">Dear Merry,</a></p>

        <p>I'm working on a design home computer CPU. So far, I haven't published my designs, but you can read my ideas at: <a href="/posts/pippin/">Pippin: the 32-bit microprocessor we all deserved</a></p>
