        <p>I'm an elitist and a perfectionist, so I spend more of my time thinking than doing. This sucks for actually getting anything done, but all the time I've spent researching to back my viewpoint has given me a serious case of <b>Too Much Information</b>. (!!!)</p>
        <p>The doctor(s) told me the only cure is for me to write down everything I think about and convince internet strangers to read it.</p>
        <p>OK, maybe that's not a real thing, but I find so many based things for me <i>not</i> to write some posts about it on the internet.</p>
        <p>Tune in later to check out what I've written!</p>
