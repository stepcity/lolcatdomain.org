        <p>I'm an elitist and a perfectionist, so I spend more of my time thinking than doing. This sucks for actually getting anything done, but all the time I've spent researching to back my viewpoint has given me a serious case of <b>Too Much Information</b>. (!!!)</p>
        <p>The doctor(s) told me the only cure is for me to write down everything I think about and convince internet strangers to read it.</p>
        <p>OK, maybe that's not a real thing, but I've learned about too many based things for me to <i>not</i> write some posts about it on the internet.</p>
        <p>Here are my posts so far:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/posts/merry/">Dear Merry,</a></li>
