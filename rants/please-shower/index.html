        <h2>Please take a shower :(</h2>
        <p>... and other hygiene related tips by Dr. Seuss!</p>
        <p>OK, in all seriousness, I need you guys to be better. This isn't just for the geeked out losers in my own community &mdash; EVERYBODY needs better hygiene.</p>
        <p>Some rooms, deep down in the underbelly of my school, have a funk permeating within. I walk in and feel a wave of humid odor wash over me and I feel my fight-or-flight kick in. Someone sits down next to me and the odor gets worse... WHEN DOES IT END?!?!</p>
        <p>And it's not just showering. That's just the most obvious one. But when I daily observe people walk away from a urinal, turn the sink on, turn it off, and leave (notice how they never stuck their hand in the water?), I feel genuine disappointment in the world.</p>
        <p>Please guys. Wash your hands. Take a shower. Brush your teeth. Wear deodorant. I don't like how uncomfortable it feels to exist in public.</p>
