        <h2>Walk on the right side!</h2>
        <p>If you asked someone which side of the road the drove on, the answer would generally be the same. We all agree that staying consistent and predictable makes for more efficient movement, right? But for all the people I've asked about which side they <i>walk</i> on, most people say they don't even think about it.</p>
        <p>What. The. Hell. Guys!!! What's wrong with us as a society?!?! Do you all understand how horrible this is?</p>
        <p>Every single day I have to endure the stresses of understanding that everybody around me is walking <i>wrong</i>. It's awful!</p>
        <p>I walk in a straight line with a consistent speed at the right side of the path. People around me should by all means be capable of predicting exactly where I'm going to go. Walking near me should be a piece of cake.</p>
        <p>And yet, for some inexplicable reason, everybody else manages to screw it up. They:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Walk in a horizontal line with their friends, blocking the path</li>
            <li>Stop in the middle of the path without warning</li>
            <li>Slow down to chat with other people</li>
            <li>Speed up to chat with other people</li>
            <li>Walk on the incorrect side, and when they're about to collide, they move <i>closer</i> to you instead of away</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, I'm not saying these things should never happen. I completely understand the natural human desire to socialize and I get that some people don't know the rules.</p>
        <p>But there is a time and a place, and if you're walking near other people, it's probably not the right time and/or place.</p>
        <p>I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. I would've expected that people could at least be bothered to even walk courteously.</p>
