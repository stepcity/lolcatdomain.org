        <h2>Rants</h2>
        <p>I try to stay positive. I really do!<br>... but too often, I find that things just aren't the way they should be.</p>
        <p>Ideally I'd like to flesh these out into full-fledged posts: carefully thought out essays that communicate my ideas effectively. But it's a lot easier (and perhaps a lot more fun :D) to just write down my complaints in the heat of the moment.</p>
        <p>Expect frequent rants in the future!</p>
